# Prior Art

Pax draws design inspiration from, among others:

#### Verilog, VHDL
For highly functional & highly declarative logic, and for [designable](./reference-designability.md) logic, teaching that it is possible for visual tooling to read & write code that can also be read & written by hand.

#### Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver
For instilling the paradigm of _design tools that create software_ (contrast with: _design tools that create pictures._)  

Flash specifically, for teaching that it is possible to bring a higher level of _art_ to interactive digital media, if we empower artists with the right tools and better-enable collaboration between designers & developers.

#### The World Wide Web, HTML, CSS
For instilling a paradigm of openness, for becoming the substrate of the free exchange of human knowledge, for championing accessibility, for achieving a nearly ubiquitous VM & runtime, for achieving a "zero-trust" application runtime, and for establishing a _lingua franca_ of UI authoring + ergonomic expectations.

#### React, Vue, Angular
For establishing the "components all the way down" approach to UI authoring; for bringing this approach to the mainstream, and for helping push the modern Web platform toward its pinnacle form.

#### Flutter, Xamarin, Unity, Qt, Electron, and React Native
For their various approaches to cross-platform application runtimes.

#### Visual Basic, ASP.NET
VB for its visual building approach to GUIs and ASP.NET for championing the "code-behind" model, separating concerns of _UI content and behavior_ from _application logic,_ and doing so in a multi-language way.

#### VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, Excel
For teaching that writing simple expressions (formulae) is accessible to a huge audience of users, beyond traditional developers.  For fundamentally transforming how humans interact with data & computers.

#### The Nintendo Entertainment System
For doing so much with so little, for years of childhood wonder, exploration, and reflex honing, and for the model of the "cartridge + console," borrowed architecturally for Pax's [compilation model.](./reference-compilation-model.md).
