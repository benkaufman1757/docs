# Native Rendering

- Two layers:
Native layer
Virtual (canvas) layer


- Clipping


- Accessibility; Screen readabiltiy


- SEO



- Message-passing via FFI, C Structs



- Adding new native rendering elements
 - Add CRUD handlers 
 - Not too difficult: feels like writing a web server, handling various kinds of request


- Current Limitations

 - Opacity + layering

 - Occlusion
    There may be certain combinations of native & virtual elements
