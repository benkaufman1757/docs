# Compiling & Packaging

Once you have written a Pax program, you will likely want to package it for distribution to users beyond yourself.

The Pax compiler ([source code](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax-lang/src/pax-compiler/)) is responsible for the heavy lifting, both for developing Pax projects (`pax run`) and compiling for distribution (`pax build`)

For further reading about the architecture and internals of the compiler, see: [Pax's compilation model](/reference-compilation-model)
