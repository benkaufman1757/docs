# Goals

Pax is designed and built with aims to be:

#### Free and open
Permissive free and open source license, free to fork, use commercially, collaborate, and contribute.  Refer to the [License](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax-lang/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

#### Portable & universal
Run on as many screens and devices as possible.

#### High performance
Support high-FPS (up to 120fps) rendering & animations and low-latency (<20ms) interactions

#### Accessible
Support accessibility (a11y) at least as well as the target operating system

#### Lightweight
Keep a small footprint, across disk (<100kb WASM bundle or LLVM binary baseline), memory (<10MB baseline), and CPU (TBD: target benchmark, perhaps `(avg. % core) per megapixel`?)

#### Ergonomic & familiar
Whenever possible, build off of established conventions and ergonomics â€” strive to "feel familiar".

#### Designable
Support mixing & matching _machine editability_ of Pax alongside _hand-editability_.  Read more about this in the chapter [Designability](./reference-designability.md).
