# Goals

#### Free and open
Permissive free and open source license, free to fork, use commercially, collaborate, and contribute.  Refer to the [License](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax-lang/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

#### Portable & universal
Run on as many screens and devices as possible.

#### High performance
Support high-FPS rendering & animations and low-latency interactions

#### Lightweight
Keep a small footprint, across disk (<100kb WASM bundle baseline), memory (<10MB), and CPU (TBD: target benchmark, perhaps (% core) per megapixel?)

#### Ergonomic & familiar
Whenever possible, build off of established conventions and ergonomics â€” strive to "feel familiar".

#### Designable
Support mixing & matching _machine editability_ of Pax alongside _hand-editability_.  Read more about this in the chapter [Designability](./reference-designability.md).
