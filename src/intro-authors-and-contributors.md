# Authors & Contributors

The Pax open source project is stewarded by the Pax Language Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit currently <!--[welcoming members](googleform?) and -->pursuing 501(c)(3) status.

The initial author of Pax was [Zack Brown](https://www.twitter.com/zackaboo), who designed the language and built the first versions of the compiler and runtimes during a personal sabbatical from 2021-2022.  He also wrote the initial version of this book.

A list of contributors to the Pax project may be found via the repository on [Github.](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax/)
