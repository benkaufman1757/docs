# Authors & Contributors

The Pax open source project is stewarded by the Pax Language Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit currently pursuing 501(c)3 status.

The initial author of Pax was [Zack Brown](https://www.twitter.com/zackaboo), who designed and built the initial "viable" versions of the Pax compiler and runtimes during a personal sabbatical from 2021-2022.

A list of contributors to the Pax project may be found via the repository on [Github.](https://www.github.com/pax-lang/pax-lang/)
